## Frequently asked questions

??? note "What’s your earliest availability to begin my project?"
    I usually begin new projects within 1–2 weeks of contract signing. For urgent needs, I offer flexibility and may be able to start sooner—simply share your timeline during our initial consultation.

??? note "Do you have a minimum project commitment?"
    I accept projects of any size, though engagements of 20 hours or more usually deliver the best results. We can also start with a pilot project to confirm the fit.

??? note "Could you share the industries where you’ve gained experience?"
    I’ve delivered successful outcomes across e-commerce, telecoms, innovation, logistics, design, and financial services. My expertise is especially strong in customer needs analysis, organizational strategy, process optimization, and transformation planning.

??? note "How will my data be kept secure and confidential?"
    I treat data security with the highest importance—signing NDAs at project outset, applying enterprise-grade encryption, and adhering to recognized best practices. Where needed, I seamlessly integrate into your organization’s security framework and compliance standards.

??? note "Could you outline your pricing model?"
    My pricing models include both project-based and retainer options. Fees are aligned with scope, complexity, and business value delivered—not just hours worked. For continued collaboration, I provide tailored retainer packages. During consultation, we’ll define the most effective structure for your needs.

??? note "How do you report progress and results?"
    I keep you informed with weekly updates, regular check-ins, and detailed documentation. For ongoing work, interactive dashboards allow you to track progress and results in real time.
